# Meme Launch Manager

This project is an automatic meme coin generation project based on real-time trends in Korea using CrewAi.

It consists of two main agent crews.

1. Trending Scraper: Scrapes the trends that are being discussed in Korea from all Korean trending services and determines the most discussed keywords by AI.

2. Meme Deployer: Taking the trending keywords determined by the Trending Scraper, it creates metadata for meme tokens and utilizes it to deploy meme tokens.

From the bustling chat rooms of Korean crypto-bros (who are *very* interested in global political drama, especially when it's this spicy) predicting election outcomes to global headlines swinging wildly with every tweet (or Truth Social post), $TRUMPCARD captures the essence of an era where volatility is the new stability.
